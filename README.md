ðŸŒŸ **Research Project: Detecting Alzheimer's Disease Using Smart Home Sensor Data**

### Purpose:
I am currently working on a research project aimed at detecting Alzheimer's disease using sensor data collected from a smart home environment. The goal is to develop a robust machine learning model capable of classifying sequences of sensor events as indicative of Alzheimer's or not.

### Key Components:

1. **Data Collection**:
   - The dataset comprises sequences of sensor events, including:
     - Timestamps
     - High-level and low-level sensor IDs (indicating location and sensor type)
     - Sensor values (ON/OFF)
     - Activity labels (e.g., "Cook," "Other_Activity")

2. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - I convert timestamps to numerical values (Unix timestamp) for consistency.
   - One-hot encoding ensures categorical variables (sensor IDs and activity labels) are suitable for neural network processing.

3. **Model Architecture**:
   - I chose a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) layers.
   - Bidirectional LSTMs capture temporal patterns in both forward and backward directions.
   - Dropout layers prevent overfitting.

4. **Training Process**:
   - The dataset is split into training, validation, and test sets.
   - Early stopping prevents overfitting during model training.

5. **Evaluation Metrics**:
   - I assess model performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

6. **Challenges**:
   - Ensuring data consistency and proper formatting.
   - Addressing potential class imbalance.
   - Interpreting results in a clinically meaningful way.

### Potential Impact:
If successful, this research could revolutionize Alzheimer's detection, leading to non-invasive methods for early intervention and improved patient care.
